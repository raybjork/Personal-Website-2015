            <p>Hi,</p>
            <p>I am a mechanical engineer passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology to create an improved and more sustainable future. In May I graduated from Tufts and have been working in the cleantech startup space in Boston since then. I love being active outside, music, and building/hacking projects with my friends. My main engineering strengths and interests lie in controls/systems engineering and mechanical design. Recently, financial issues at my company have forced me to seek out other employment. I invite you to explore this website that I built. Take a look at my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> of projects or <a href="mailto:raybjork@gmail.com">email me</a> if you are interested in learning more about me.</p>

            <p>Update 10/28/2015 - I made this site from scratch during the past two weeks using HTML/CSS/Javascript. It is still under construction and is currently missing a lot of content. If you are having trouble viewing it, that may be because it was optimized for a 15" display. I am working on making it more compatible with other veiwing window sizes. If you find bugs please contact me and let me know I am trying to find and fix them. I will be adding more content in the coming weeks.</p>
