            <h2>Team Leader for First Place Team</h2>
            <p>In my senior year at Tufts, another classmate and I took on the responsibility of leading <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tuftsracing?ref=bookmarks">Tufts Racing</a>. The mission of this volunteer student group is to engineer a car to compete in the <a href="http://www.formula-hybrid.org/about/">Formula Hybrid competition</a> and, in doing so, gain valuable hands-on experience outside the classroom. In the beginning of my tenure as Team Leader, the organization was facing opposition from Tufts administration and afragmented student team that needed a management overhaul. Over the course of the year we reorganized the structure of the organization and redesigned many of the car's major systems. Despite the obstacles our team faced over the year, we managed to build <a href="http://www.tuftsracing.com/car/">Blue Shell</a>, pass the rigorous technical and safety requirements placed on us by the competition, and <a href="http://tuftsdaily.com/features/2015/09/08/tufts-racing-team-triumphs-obstacles-rises-1st-place/">win first place in the all-electric division for the first time in the program's history</a>! Today Tufts Racing continues as an organization that helps transform undergraduates into engineers.</p>

                <h3 style="color:black;">Redesigning an Electric Drivetrain</h3>
            </a>
            <p class="collapsable" style="display:none">For my senior capstone project, I undertook the task of redesigning the drivetrain for our electric vehicle with three team members. The system integrated a new motor with the team's existing chassis and also featured vibration damping elements tuned to minimize driving-induced shocks, as well as a redesigned power transmission system. In three months the detailed design, documentation, integration and testing were completed according to the milestone schedule we set for ourselves.
                <br>
                <br> Properly damping vibrations to the motor was one of the challenges of this project. Mathematical analysis of the car's vehicle dynamics led us to choosing a material with appropriate spring and damping coefficients. Impulses were transmitted through a carefully selected elastomeric pad and into a separate chassis, built specifically to vibrationally isolate these two systems.
                <br>
                <br> The proper alignment of the drivetrain sprockets necessitated tight tolerances within a very constrained space inside the existing chassis. This made manufacturing and implementation of our solution difficult. In light of this, design for manufacturability was highly emphasized. Our creative use of space and the high standards to which we manufactured our parts ensured a good fit to the car.
                <br>
                <br> The drivetrain sprockets were chosen to optimize efficiency, given that the car would have to run on batteries. This proved to be one of the strengths of the design as the car used the battery charge economically and fared very well in the endurance portion of the competition.
                <br>
                <br> Failure analysis of the motor mounting system was conducted through FEA simulations to determine if the weak points of the new system would be strong enough to withstand the rugged conditions of a racecar. This was then qualified in the lab using an accelerometer to measure the forces felt by the system.
                <br>
                <br>Completion of this project was a huge milestone for Tufts Racing because it laid the foundation on which to base design decisions for the rest of the year. It also showed our team members and sponsors the success we were capable of and gave us the momentum and confidence to continue our victorious 2015 campaign.

                <h3 style="color:black;">Effective Project Management</h3></a>
            <p class="collapsable" style="display:none">Being the Team Leader of Tufts Racing was the defining experience of my college career. I began my involvement with the team as a freshman and worked my way up in the leadership as I became more experienced. I  fully appreciated the work involved in running this organization once I had the responsibilities of the Team Leader. In addition to overseeing the technical development of the car by working with Project Leaders, the Team Leaders were responsible for day to day team operations, educating and passing down knowledge to younger members, communicating with school administrators, teambuilding, and organizing the business efforts of the team with budgeting, fundraising and recruiting. Through our strategy in handling this role, my co-leader and I <a href="http://www.formula-hybrid.org/wp-content/uploads/2015-FH-SCORING-SUMMARY-Final-1.pdf">won first place in the Project Management portion of the Formula Hybrid competition</a>. Below are some of the objectives I had over the year and my musings on how to effectively manage a student Formula team.</p>
            <p class="collapsable" style="display:none;">One of the major issues with Tufts Racing in the years prior to my term as Team Leader was a lack of clear organizational structure. This was one of my focuses in leadership. My co-leader and I created a new leadership structure within the club with the purpose of distributing responsibility evenly within the club and increasing accountability. Technical Project Leaders were responsible for major projects and subsystems of the car and each had their own younger team members working with them. A separate Administrative Board assisted us with some of the necessary club functions such as our finances, web presence and organizing for the year-end competition. This method proved effective throughout the 2015 year, and has evolved from our framework into an improved system for the 2016 team. I am optimistic that the management of Tufts Racing will be one of the teamâ€™s strengths in years to come. 
                <br>
                <br> When meditiating on the purpose for Tufts Racing, I initially believed that our primary goal should be engineering a competitive car to win the Formula Hybrid competition. Upon further reflection though I came to the conclusion that the objective should be to provide undergraduates with an educational, hands-on experience that is able to prepare them for work as part of an interdisciplinary engineering team solving real world problems. This was made difficult due to the inherent volunteer nature of the program though. Securing student involvement amidst a myriad of other priorities was difficult. To promote the educational aspect of the club, I gave more responsibility to upperclassmen members to increase their involvement in the team. I assigned undergraduate members of the team to work on projects that best matched their academic interests. In this way, a mentor relationship was formed between the older Project Leaders and younger team members. To further increase teamwork and participation I organized several social events over the course of the year, which bonded our team together as friends and not just classmates. In one Projet group, an upperclassman mentor taught vehicle dynamics, suspension systems, and manufacturing practices to three students from his team. As a response they were very enthusiastic about continuing their involvement in the club as Project Leaders for the 2016 season. Their shining example validates the program I put in place and illustrates how effective mentoring can gradually transform from year to year. 
                <br>
                <br>My thoughts on project management for Tufts Racing are encapsulated by some of the business presentations I wrote for the Formula Hybrid competition. It is my strong belief that the community that the Tufts Racing 2015 team built over the year was the factor that enabled teamwork from our team at critical moments during the compettion.

            </a>
            <p class="collapsable" style="display:none;">My senior year with Tufts Racing, I managed the CAD files comprising our racecar.vvI, rebuilt the master assembly for our car from a series of sub-assemblies that I compiled. This involved reverse engineering several parts to make accurate models. Keeping an up-to-date version of our vehicle CAD files was important for design decisions and documentation purposes. As a result, I gained  experience working with parts and large assemblies in SolidWorks and its add-ons. Because Tufts Engineering did not teach CAD in intro level classes, I held a job as a teaching assistant where I gave bi-weekly tutoring sessions for freshman students after class. Senior year I extended these hours and taught SolidWorks to several of our freshman team members so that they could keep our CAD updated after my graduation.</p>

                <h3 style="color:black;">Machining Experience in the Auto Shop</h3></a>
            <p class="collapsable" style="display:none">For the four years that I worked with Tufts Racing I had the opportunity to practice my machining techniques by making parts for the car. Today I have experience using the following techniques thanks to the time I spent in the auto shop</p>
            <ul class="collapsable" style="display:none">
                <li>Using saws, drill presses, tap and die sets, angle/bench grinders,
                    <br> and other hand tools for metal, wood and plastic</li>
                <li>High and low voltage electrical wiring to meet standards</li>
                <li>CNC machining</li>
                <li>Laser cutting acrylic</li>
                <li>3D Printing</li>
                <li>Manual mill and lathe</li>
                <li>Sheet metal part fabrication</li>
                <li>Painting and finishing parts</li>
                <li>MIG Welding</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="collapsable" style="display:none">I am also very proud that during my term as Team Leader, there were no safety incidents. Though the school was not convinced of this, our team was very good about enforcing safety in our shop. Our track record of safety includes two months that the team was not allowed to use our shop because of safety concerns. During this time, my basement became a makeshift shop where all our manufacturing activities took place.
