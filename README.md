The purpose of this repository is to save the code for my personal webpage.  I am starting this project as a way to practice my new HTML/CSS skills as well as centralize all the information that will be relevant to my job search.  It will start off simply and increase in complexity as my web developing confidence grows.  This document will be continually updated and will describe the relevant files for this project as they are created.
